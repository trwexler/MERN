Ternary Operator

The MDN Docs has a solid definition of what a ternary operator is:

    The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.

Essentially, a ternary operator is a short version of an if statement. Let's go over the difference between the two with a couple basic examples:

Let's say I want to create a function to determine if I can or cannot afford an item:
Basic if statement
Ternary statement


If we invoke either of these functions, they will return the same exact result. The only difference is the ternary statement is shorter.
Special Note

Take care when nesting ternary statements, as they can tend to become unwieldy and unreadable. For instance, consider the following:

const myVar = 10 < 20
    ? 5 < 10
        ? true
        : false
    : false

Imagine coming back to read that code after 6 months...
